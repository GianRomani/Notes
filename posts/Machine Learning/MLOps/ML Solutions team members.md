- Data scientist -> 20%;
- Data Engineer -> 30%
- Software Engineer -> 20%
- ML Engineer -> 20%
- MLOps -> 10%

Obviously all depends on the budget (tight budget -> search for engineers with multiple skills).
Focus initially on data engineers and data scientist, add others as models deliver reasonable results.
