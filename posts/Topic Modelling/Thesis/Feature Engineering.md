Feature engineering:
- geographic feature -> consider if post is about experience in Italy, Europe or reast of the world, so that if a user liked or posted about experiences in Italy (for example), he will receive recommendations about experiences in Italy;
- a lot of experiences don't have the duration explicitly expressed -> extract duration of experience from test?:
- it could be interesting to use the date of the experience (at least month, semester and if it was during a weekend or not);
- views divided by usefulnes;
- add location name as feature?;
- description style?;
- sentiments in posts?
