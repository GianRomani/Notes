To enhance performances of the recommendation system:

-   #trust:
	-   user trust->based on other users or implicit info;
	-   item trust-> based on feedback from users or on how users interact with items;
-   #folkonomies:
	-   to create tag recommendation systems;
	-   to enrich recommendation processes using tags;
-   #social_filtering -> creation of a community network (or affinity network), generally used with a trust-based CF system.
