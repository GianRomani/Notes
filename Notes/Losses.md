**Pointwise loss**: minimization of the squared loss between predicted score $y_{u,i}$ and target value $y(u,i)$. To use negative feedback, all unobserved entries are considered as negative examples or some unobserved entries are sampled to be negative instances.

**Paiwise loss**: aims to rank observed entries higher than the unobserved ones by maximizing the margin between observed entries and unobserved entries.
