Â [Most foreign nationals require a permit to work in Switzerland, and the procedure for obtaining a permit depends on your nationality and type of employment](https://www.ch.ch/en/foreign-nationals-in-switzerland/working-in-switzerland/)[1](https://www.ch.ch/en/foreign-nationals-in-switzerland/working-in-switzerland/)

For employment longer than 3 months, you must apply for a residence permit from the Swiss commune in which you are living before starting work. You will be have to submit the following documents:
- a valid identity card or passport
