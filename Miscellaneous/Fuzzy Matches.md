A fuzzy match happens when a translator implements a new source text or phrase and it doesn't match one of these “pre-translated” phrases exactly, but is really close.

The primary function of fuzzy matching is to assist the translator by speeding up the translation process. When an exact match can’t be found in the [[Translation memories]] database for the text being translated, translation management systems (TMSs) often have the option to search for a match that is less than exact. Potential matches are provided to the translator as additional input for final translation.
