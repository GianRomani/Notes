My name is Gianfranco. 
I'm a recent Master's graduate in Engineering in Computer Science from Sapienza University of Rome with experience in AI and machine learning.

I have started taking this notes on Obsidian when I was working for my thesis.
Now this collection of notes is about things I am interested in, mostly ML, NLP, Recommender Systems, but I am planning to extend the topics covered to more topics :)

I'm also on the hunt for a full-time machine learning role, so if you're hiring reach out! I can most easily be reached via:
