Hello there!
I am an Applied Machine Learning Scientist at Thomson Reuters at the Zug office (Switzerland). I am working mostly on ML products for Tax and accounting.

I graduated with a Master's degree in Engineering in Computer Science from Sapienza University of Rome with experience in AI and machine learning.

I have started taking this notes on Obsidian when I was working for my thesis.
Now this collection of notes is about things I am interested in, mostly ML, NLP, Recommender Systems, and Safety for LLM-based applications, but I am planning to extend the topics covered to more topics :)

I can most easily be reached via:

I am also leaving [here](https://github.com/GianRomani) a link to my GitHub repository.
