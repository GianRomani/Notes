TO-DO:
- Try to implement [[CoSeRNN]] and see if the amount of data we have is enough;
- Try to enlarge the data:
	- scrape data -> TripAdvisor has reviews of experiences which could receive the "Helpful" vote. Pros: I could go to the user profile to see reviews that have such vote and get the users that voted and I have several images. Cons: I cannot create the sessions from such data and few likes;
	- data augmentation
- If the data is not enough change to simpler methods
- MLOps
