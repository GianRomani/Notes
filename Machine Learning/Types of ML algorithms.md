There are three main categories of algorithms (but we can combine them):
- **Supervised learning**: it consists in inferring a function from labelled training data. Tasks: classification, regression, ranking. Models: SVM, regression, naive Bayes, decision trees, KNN;
- **Unsupervised learning**: used to find patterns is data, we do not have label to predict. Tasks: [[Clustering]], anomaly detection,
- **Reinforcement learning**: it does not need labelled data, but it focuses in finding a balance between exploration and exploitation of an agent in an environment in order to maximize a cumulative reward.
