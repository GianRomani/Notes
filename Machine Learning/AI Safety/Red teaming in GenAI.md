Building a Responsible GenAI app is not just a matter of prompts and infrastructure  design, but also an UX design.

The first step would be to define what are the Red flags and behaviors we want to avoid -> work with SMEs to define these aspects.

Then the UX/UI design will influence which problems we will face (and it could solve some of those) -> put user at the center while designing the product.

After these two steps we can think about technological problems for safety.
