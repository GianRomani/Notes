One of the [[Vulnerabilities in LLM-base applications]].

LLM model theft occurs when malicious actors gain unauthorized access to proprietary language models. This theft, whether through physical compromise, copying, or extracting weights and parameters, poses severe risks:
- **Economic Loss:** Theft undermines investments in model development and damages the owner's financial interests.
- **Reputational Damage:** Model theft erodes trust and can harm a company's reputation.
- **Competitive Disadvantage:** Stolen models can be used by competitors or to create unauthorized, potentially harmful replicas.
- **Data Exposure:** Sensitive information embedded in the model may be compromised.

Organizations must prioritize strong security measures to safeguard their valuable LLM models:
- **Robust Access Controls:** Implement strict access controls to limit who can interact with the model.
- **Encryption:** Protect models at rest and in transit using strong encryption.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Monitor for unusual activity or attempts to access the model.

Proactive security measures are crucial to protect intellectual property, maintain a competitive edge, and prevent the misuse of potentially sensitive data.
