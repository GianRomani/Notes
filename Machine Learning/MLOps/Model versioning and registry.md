ML models evolve over time as new training data and different hyperparameters are used.

Benefits:
- linking with training data versions;
- linking with model hyperparameters;
- performance improvement analytics;
- integration and testing;
- model life cycle management

A model registry is a database containing a model and metadata associated to it. Contents:
- serialized model;
- model ID, version, description;
- hyperparameters;
- model status;
- model history;
- link to input data versions, code versions and performance results.

Thanks to the registry we obtain traceability, reproducibility, life cycle management, automation, governance, and we facilitate communication.
