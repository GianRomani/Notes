### Cnvrg.io

Platform to automate training and deployment of AI and ML models, i.e. it manages the entire lifecycle.
**AI Blueprints** -> low-code, open-source ML pipelines.
They also serve already trained models.
Comparable platforms:
- Azure ML studio
- AWS sagemaker
- Google AI Hub
But all this other platforms are not cloud agnostic (so they work just inside their infrastructure).

In Experiments I can schedule, lunch and control the experiements.
In Compute section I can check the environments I am using/I can use.
I can add files from/to a git repository.
In Serving I can find the code needed to serve the endpoint.
Dash is used for the web interface.
