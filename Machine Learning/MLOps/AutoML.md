AutoML is the automation of machine learning activities to enable modeling building and  decision-making without human intervention throughout the ML life cycle.

Scope:
- feature engineering -> delete useless feature, feature correlation and selection;
- model training -> model selection, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble training;
- deployment;
- customization -> model customization by use case.

**Benefits**:
- efficiency;
- speed of training and deployment;
- better results (search of optimal hyperparameters);
- accessibility.

**Shortcomings**:
- new use cases may create errors;
- bias may go untracked;
- processing capacity;
- explainability.
