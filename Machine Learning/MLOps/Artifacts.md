Artifact are any entities that are created and/or consumed during a process.
In software engineering ([[DevOps]]) we deal primarily with two artifacts: code and records (requirements, test results etc).
Software engineering process deals with managing life cycle of artifacts. During this process artifacts are used, consumed and created.

In ML engineering we have four kinds of artifacts: Records, Code, Data and Models.
Ml Development challenges:
- each artifdact follows its own life cycle but needs coordination;
- managing collaboration between artifacts increases multifold;
- need for additional tools and workflows to manage and govern them.

Each artifact needs difference sets of skills and teams.
