Create an optimal end-to-end workflow that integrates different teams, modules, tools, and artifacts to continuously improve and deliver machine learning solutions.

 **Principles**:
 - modular;
 - reproducible,
 - integrated;
 - continuous;
 - scalable;
 - responsive;
 - automated;
 - observable;
 - transparent;
 - incremental;
 - traceable;
 - collaborative;
 - managed;
 - secure;
 - organized.

**Requirements** are fundamental for the success of a ML project:
- Non-ML requirements:
	- user experience;
	- solution functions;
	- deployment;
	- scale;
	- security;
	- serviceability;
- ML requirements:
	- function;
	- performance goals (effectiveness);
	- operational goals (efficiency);
	- cost.
