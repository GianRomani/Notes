There are several optiont to format an ml model:
- serializing the model with pickle;
- MLFlow provides a serialization format;
- language-agnostic exchange format (ONNX, PMML etc).

There are various architecture we can consider when deploying an ML model:
1. Embedded approach: a trained model is embedded as a dependency in the application. Simplicity instead of flexibility;
2. Dedicated Model API: the model is external to the application and is called through an API (REST, gRPC etc). The tradeoff is inverted, i.e. flexibility is elevated but system is more complex;
3. Model published as Data: applications subscribe to events and ingest new models in memory;
4. Offline predictions: asynchronous, prediction-on-the-fly is not available but we can check the predictions before serving them to the users.
