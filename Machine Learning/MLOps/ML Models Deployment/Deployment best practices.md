To have a successful [[Model Deployment]], consider the following aspects:
- Observation and Rollback
	- deployment will fail from time to time
	- create plan for deployments (rollout strategy, validation criteria and test plan, rollback criteria and strategy)
	- periodically test the plan
- Automation -> to properly scale
	- it improves agility through human trigger and workflow trigger
