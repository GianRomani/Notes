Image segmentation is a computer vision task in which we label specific regions of an image according to what's being shown.
Because we're predicting for every pixel in the image, this task is commonly referred to asÂ **dense prediction**.

**Applications:**
1. Autonomous vehicles;
2. Medical image diagnostics.

**Representation of the task:** the goal is to take an image and output a segmentation map where each pixel contains a class label represented as an integer.
