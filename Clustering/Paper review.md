# Goals
Be on the same page with Maryam about the approaches used and the metrics used to evaluate the approaches.

# Action items
- [ ] WEClustering with sentence transformer and HDBSCAN -> BERT with sentence transformer
- [ ] Evaluation metrics:
	- [x] PMI
	- [x] inter/intra cluster
	- [x] topic coherence ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14914.pdf))
	- [x] topic diversity and predictive accuracy ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00498.pdf))
- [ ] AlBERT and XLNet
