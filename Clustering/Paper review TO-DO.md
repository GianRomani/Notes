# Goals
Be on the same page with Maryam about the approaches used and the metrics used to evaluate the approaches.

# Action items
- [ ] WEClustering with sentence transformer and HDBSCAN: BERT with sentence transformer -> I think that the mothod used by Maryam is more similar to [[BERTopic]] than [[Clustering/WEClustering]] -> check this
- [x] Evaluation metrics:
	- [x] PMI
	- [x] inter/intra cluster
	- [x] topic coherence ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14914.pdf))
	- [x] topic diversity and predictive accuracy ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00498.pdf))
- [x] AlBERT and XLNet
- [ ] Other approaches:
	- [ ] NMF ([here](https://towardsdatascience.com/topic-modeling-articles-with-nmf-8c6b2a227a45) and [here](https://medium.com/voice-tech-podcast/topic-modelling-using-nmf-2f510d962b6e))
	- [ ] LDA2Vec
	- [ ] Neural topic modeling [here](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-acl.382.pdf)


For topic coherence -> [gensim]([Hyperparameters tuning â€” Topic Coherence and LSI model | by Eleonora Fontana | Betacom | Medium](https://medium.com/betacom/hyperparameters-tuning-topic-coherence-and-lsi-model-d31701f8aeec#:~:text=Topic%20Coherence%20in%20Python%20As%20stated%20in%20the,in%20order%20to%20choose%20the%20best%20num_topics%20value.))
