## 2) Background
### 2.1) Definition of Terms
Topic modeling methods can be applied to a great variety of fields and data types, including information retrieval ([paper](https://maroo.cs.umass.edu/getpdf.php?id=850)), bioinformatics ([review](https://springerplus.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40064-016-3252-8)) and topic discovery in images ([paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1541280.?casa_token=CuY86UvTQWwAAAAA:Mh1AaYah3cD5a6lZVorn2Qj_OXvg76RosG1rSdVW5INWzq3NWIVYwWdMRZcVZnrxuJDH)). Our work focuses on approaches that can be used for text-based data.
A typical text-based dataset is made of "documents" which are strings of variable length composed of *N* words, where a "word" (or "term") is considered as the fundamental unit of a sample. The set of distinct words present in a dataset forms a "vocabulary" and a “topic” is then viewed as a probability distribution over this fixed vocabulary.
