Investigate how language affects results
multiple plots for the datasets (one figure for datasets, composed by multiple plots):
x-axis techniques
y-axis value of a score

OR (one figure for score, composed by multiple datasets)

x-axis technique
y-axis 


TO-DOs:
- [x] Investigate number of topics (elbow rule)
- [x] Investigate parameters 
- [x] plot as explained above
- [x] see literature to check if our results are valid compared to the ones in the papers
- [x] discrepancy on number of topics (between models and datasets) -> find explaination
- [x] draft section 2 of the paper


Questions:
- For those methods that can decide automatically the optimal number of topics, do we have to compute the coherence and diversity with such number of clusters? 
- To compute the score metrics, how many words do we want to consider (top10, top20)?
