To-do:
- [x] categories to one hot encoding -> but they are lists;
- [x] dates in right format;
- [x] normalize duration?
- [x] texts;
	- [x]   remove emojis;
	- [x]   remove stopwords and punctuation;
	- [x]   remove verbs;
	- [x]   remove adjectives;
	- [x]   tf-id;
	- [x]   togliere hashtags;
	- [ ]   one-hot di hashtags?; 

Ideas:
- I could check how many posts the user did and add it as a feature;
- it could be interesting to use the date of the experience (at least month, semester and if it was during a weekend or not);
- views/useful;
- add location name as feature?
- description style?
