Explicit feedback -> user's characteristics

Implicit feedback -> data is obtained from user's interaction with the app. Advantage: is easier to collect. Drawback: no readily available negative feedback.

Take in consideration that there is always a certain amount of bias (that are users that are more disposed to give low ratings, or it is universally know that a certain item is better than the rest of similar items)

User's ratings and tastes can change over time, can be influenced by recent interactions or by external events.
