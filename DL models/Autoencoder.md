# Autoencoder
Created: 2022-03-24 10:16

An autoencoder is a neural network that reconstructs its input data in the output layer-> the encoder maps the input to an internal representation and the decoder that maps this representation to a reconstruction of the input.

Pros: #dimensionality_reduction, #data_reconstruction, #feature_extraction

Two approaches:
- usning autoencoders to learn lower-dimensional feature representations at the bottleneck layer;
- filling the blanks of the interaction matrix directly in the reconstruction layer

Types:
- Denoising AE;
- Variational AE;
- Contractive AE;
- Marginalized AE
