## Features:
- title + description -> tf-idf, word2vec, transformers; [[How to use textual data]]
- counterUseful -> rating?;
- viewCounter;
- one hot encoding of categories;
- duration_min;
- days

## Ideas for [[Posts]]:
- it could be interesting to use the date of the experience (at least month, semester and if it was during a weekend or not);
- views divided by usefulnes;
- add location name as feature?
- description style?;
- sentiments in posts?;
- I could use the likes as the target for the training of a model -> wide and deep structure to predict if a user is going to like a certain post -> I need info about users;
- define clusters of user using the posts they wrote 

## Ideas for [[Users]]:
- \#posts he made;
- total \#likes;
- \#likes per category;
- average duration of the experiences she/he made;
- where she/he lives;
- hashtags;
- location of posts he/she made (for example did he travel mostly abroad or in Italy?); 
- Embedding representation? (from posts he made maybe)[[Text-based collaborative filtering for cold-start soothing and recommendation enrichment]] [[Bert4Vec]] [[Embedding-based News Recommendation for Millions of Users]]
