Problems/doubts: #doubt 
- Distribution of user's activity (how many are active, i.e they post regularly or at least like other posts); [[Users]]
- too few likes? [[Posts]] [[Cold-start]];
- which categories receive more views  and/or likes? [[Posts]]
- how to use images? And, more importantly, can I access the images posted (not just the Ids)? [[Images]];
- how to use geographic locations of posts and users? [[Posts]]  [[Users]];
- datePublishing > creationDate in [[Posts]], some datePublishing are null, it means that some posts are not published yet? How to deal with this?
- 'tempo libero' and 'aria aperta' are now the same thing?
- is there somewhere the date of the experiences?
