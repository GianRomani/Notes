**Stability** -> recommendations that are close in time should not change much after a little amount of time.

**Reliability** -> how much we can trust the recommendation, i.e. we can trust it if an item is recommended because a lot of users similar to us liked it, if an object is rated by a small amount of users the recommendation is less trustable.
