Three kinds of coverage are considered:
1. Item space coverage: it refers to the extent of items that a recommender system is able to make predictions -> set of items that the RS is capable of working with. There are few metrics since coverage is not really used.
2. User space coverage: it refers to the proportion of users that a RS can predict items to. No metrics found.
3. Genre space coverage: it refers to the number of distinct genres of items that are effectively recommended to users.
