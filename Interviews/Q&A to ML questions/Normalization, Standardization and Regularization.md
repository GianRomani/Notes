1. Normalization adjusts the data -> if the data is on a very different scale, we need to normalize it (generally in a range [0,1]);
2. Standardization re-scales data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1;
3. Regularization adjusts the prediction function by working on the weights in our model.
